  <h3>JupyterHub</h3>

  <p>
    If you have trouble setting up your own machine, we will have a fully online
    JupyterHub option available for all UMN users with a valid UMN login:
    <a href="https://notebooks.latis.umn.edu/"
      >https://notebooks.latis.umn.edu/</a
    >
    Log in with UMN internet ID and password, then select “SWC - SQL” from the
    server choices. No need to do anything else. All the necessary files and
    software are already there.
